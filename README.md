#Visual Studio integration add-in for Cppcheck

[Cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) is a C and C++ source code static analysis tool.

This plugin integrates Cppcheck into Visual Studio and allows:

 * automatically checking every C / C++ source file upon saving;
 * checking the currently selected project in the Solution Explorer (menu -> Tools -> Check current project).

###Note

You'll need Visual Studio SDK installed before you can open and build the project.
